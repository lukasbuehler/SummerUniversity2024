# Python-HPC 

For this part of the Summer School, we are going to use Jupyter which is accessible vising jupyter.cscs.ch.
A kernel with name `su2024` has been prepared which contains all the necessary libraries that are going to be used during the lectures.
You just need to execute the script `/scratch/snx3000/class256/course-setup.py` from a terminal which is going to create the kernel for you.
