This is called *memory coalescing* in CUDA's terminology. In our example, a warp needs to fetch $32\\times 8 = 256$ bytes, i.e., 2 memory transactions of 128 bytes each ideally. However, due to the row-major layout of the matrix $A$, each thread does a separate 32 byte transaction, generating $32\\times 32 = 1024$ bytes memory traffic per warp, which is four times more than the ideal!

This can either act as L1 data cache memory (default mode) or it can serve as programmable scratchpad at the disposal of the programmer. This memory is shared among all the threads of a CUDA block. We are going to modify our matrix-vector kernel to make use of it. If you inspect closer the algorithm, you will see that although there is no temporal locality in accesses to the matrix $A$, but the the vector $x$ is reused $N$ times. For this reason, we are going to cache the vector $x$ manually into the shared memory. The following figure shows the principle in more detail:\n",

The threads of a block (still 1D) undertake a double role: first, they fetch the $x$ vector elements into the shared memory of the block and, second, they perform the multiplication and the reduction to a local register variable. As soon as they process the full row, the store this value back to vector $y$. Here is the implementation in Numba:"

The `cuda.shared.array(shape=BLOCK_SIZE, dtype=numba.float64)` statement allocates the part of the $x$ vector that is stored in shared memory. When allocating an array in shared memory, the shape must be \"constant.\" Although constants don't exist in Python, in the context of Numba, this means that at the time the CUDA kernel is compiled, its value must be known. You may not use for example `cuda.blockDim.x`, since this is not known at the time the kernel is compiled. Strangely, though, you are not allowed to do `shape=2*CONST`, where `CONST` is a \"constant\" as defined above.\n",

This barrier affects *only* the threads of a single block. We then move to the actual computation where each thread computes a row inside the sliding window. At the end we have to synchronize again, since we need to make sure that the `lx` buffer is consumed fully, before we start refilling it in the next iteration. Finally, after the threads have gone through all the blocks in the $j$ direction, they compute the final result in $y$.\n",

    "As you might have noticed, this kernel is 20% slower than the seemingly naive one. In fact, we shouldn't have expected any improvement whatsoever, since the \"naive\" kernel already hits the memory bandwidth limit. But why manually caching didn't work? When the shared memory is not used as a scratchpad memory, it functions as a standard L1 cache. So, essentially, the caching of $x$ did happen implicitly in the original version. The only thing we have achieved with the shared memory version is to introduce an additional computational overhead due to the sliding window; `nvprof` shows that. Truth must be said though, that in the early generations of NVIDIA GPUs, where shared memory did not function as a standard cache, this optimization did give you additional performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when is shared memory beneficial? It is only when you have a kernel with a high arithmetic intensity, which implies some significant temporal locality in the memory accesses. The most prominent example of such a kernel is the matrix-matrix multiplication, which has an arithmetic intensity at the order of $N$. In such a case, you could use the shared memory to implement the tiling algorithm. An example implementation with Numba an be found [here](http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/cuda/examples.html?highlight=matrix%20matrix#matrix-multiplication). Another candidate user of shared memory could be layered stencil computations, where you could cache the intermediate layers."
